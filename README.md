# SemAttack

This is the official code base for the NAACL 2022 paper, "[SemAttack: Natural Textual Attacks via Different Semantic Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01287)".

This repo contains code to attack both English and Chinese models. We put the code in seperate folders.

You may use our code to attack other tasks or other datasets.

## Setup

1. Create environment and install requirements.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Construct BERT embedding space. We follow the process in paper ["Visualizing and Measuring the Geometry of BERT"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02715) ([GitHub](https://github.com/PAIR-code/interpretability)) to calculate word embeddings. The embedding space is stored as an N * 768 tensor, where N is the number of total embeddings. 


3. Dataset preparation. We keep the original dataset as well as the candidate perturbations generated by different semantic perturbation functions. We also provide the processed [Yelp dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nZzqaqJIhO75pkTK_AxJVzGY0uLxMJ6O?usp=sharing) as an example.

## Model Training

Use `train.py` to train your models. We also provide our pre-trained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pjPlxGWVbPpWNMueOF54f7oQP_hoJcRY?usp=sharing).

## Attack

Use `attack.py` to attack pre-trained models. For example, the script below attacks a BERT model fine-tuned on Yelp dataset using semantic perturbation function FC

```
python attack.py \
  --function cluster \
  --const 10 \
  --confidence 0 \
  --lr 0.15 \
  --load path_to_pretrained_model \
  --test-model path_to_pretrained_model \
  --test-data path_to_dataset_with_embedding_space \
  --untargeted
```

You may check the code for more details. You may also try different semantic perturbation functions and different attack parameters.
